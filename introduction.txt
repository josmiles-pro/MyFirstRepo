# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Joseph Kamanja, a passionate student dedicated to sustainable agriculture and social impact. I am currently studying entrepreneurship, computing, statistics, and business finance at the Pathway Foundation.

My mission is to help communities in Northern Kenya overcome climate challenges through sustainable livestock systems and smart technology. I enjoy learning new skills, solving problems, and sharing knowledge with others.
